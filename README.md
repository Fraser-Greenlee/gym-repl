A [REPL](https://repl.it)-like enviroment where agents can learn to code!

The goal is to learn a program that converts an input number to an output number.
The input-output pair is provided as adjacent sequences on a grid.
The model must learn to rerference the input variable `i` and to perform a sum.

Initial examples are in the range i+1 >= output >= i-1

Should only be able to output the chars `i + - 1`
