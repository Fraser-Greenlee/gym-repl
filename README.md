A [REPL](https://repl.it)-like enviroment where agents can learn to code!

Currently agents can write `+`, `-`, `1` and `clear`.

The code is run as a python program at each timestep and the output is clipped to 10 characters.

The plan is for agents to teach themselves how to code by tryng various inputs and seeing what outputs they produce.
